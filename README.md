# Playing with Scilearn kit in Jupyter Notebooks

Working through Scklearn kit 
Influenced heavily by Python Machine Learning (Sebastian Raschka) Chapter 3

The utilities Python Module has a number of useful functions that are used in the notebooks:

*  `get_iris_data(test_size=0.3)`  -> Iris Data Set retrieval, split into train/test set (default 30%, can be changed by setting test_size parameter) and standardised. Returns the `X_train_std, y_train, X_test_std, y_test, X_combined_std, y_combined`


* `plot_decision_regions(X,y,classifier, test_idx=None, resolution=0.02)`  -> plots the data and the decision regions produced by a model
